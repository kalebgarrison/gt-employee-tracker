# gt-employee-tracker


## Description 
This is a CLI Employee Tracker app that I wrote using node.js and MySQL that allows users to save and keep track of employee information. This material is designed to meet the standards set by the GT Full-stack program homework requirements. It is built using the languages mentioned and customized based on mockups in class. 

Any feedback can be provided via email at [kalebgarrison@gmail.com](mailto:kalebgarrison@gmail.com).
